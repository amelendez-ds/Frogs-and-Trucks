# Frogs & Trucks
BINARY IMAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH CIFAR-10

## Description
This is a *Binary Classification* **Deep Learning** mini project. Using the **CIFAR-10** dataset, and just 2 out of the 10 classes that are available in the original dataset. Yes, we are teaching our model to distinguish *frogs* from *trucks*!

## Data
The CIFAR-10 dataset will be downloaded from Keras, and preprocessed accordingly. You can get this data by importing `cifar10` and the `load_data` function as follows:
- `from keras.datasets import cifar10`
- `from keras.datasets.cifar10 import load_data`

CIFAR-10 is a large dataset of images with 3072 features per sample (per image) and it contains 50000 images in the original training set.

This project was a class exercise for my AI masters' *Deep Learning* course at Tilburg University (Netherlands, 2019-2020).
